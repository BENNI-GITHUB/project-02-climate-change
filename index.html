                <div class="contents">
                    <p>All of the gases on the planet make up the Earth's atmosphere. The pattern of weather conditions
                        over many years is called climate. Climate change refers to long-term alterations in Earth's
                        average weather patterns, including temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns. These changes
                        are primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases such as
                        Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. </p>
                    <h3 class="h3">Causes of Climate Change: </h3>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                        <li><b>Greenhouse Gas Emissions: </b>The burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural
                            gas) for energy, transportation, and industrial processes releases CO2 and other greenhouse
                            gases into the atmosphere.These gases trap heat, leading to a gradual increase in global
                            temperatures, known as global warming.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Deforestation: </b>Cutting down forests reduces the planet's ability to absorb CO2,
                            contributing to increased greenhouse gas concentrations.</li>
                        <li><b>Agriculture: </b> Agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and the use of
                            synthetic fertilizers, release methane and nitrous oxide, potent greenhouse gases.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Children's health is a critical concern in the context of climate change, and proactive efforts
                        are essential to protect their well-being in a changing climate.Climate change poses significant
                        risks to children's health, both directly and indirectly. As the Earth's climate continues to
                        change, it exacerbates existing health challenges and introduces new threats that
                        disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including children. Here are some key ways in
                        which climate change impacts children's health: </p>
                    <ul style="margin-right: 15px;">
                        <li><b>Lack of Access to Healthcare Due to Migration: </b>Climate change-induced events such as
                            extreme weather, sea-level rise, and droughts can force families and communities to migrate.
                            In many cases, this migration can lead to the displacement of children and their families,
                            resulting in a loss of access to healthcare services.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Shortened Food Supply and Poor Nutrition: </b>Climate change disrupts agricultural
                            patterns and reduces crop yields due to factors like increased temperatures, changing
                            precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events.</li>
                        <li><b>Limited Access to Clean Water and Increased Waterborne Illness: </b> Altered rainfall
                            patterns and prolonged droughts can affect the availability and quality of water sources,
                            making it difficult for communities, particularly children, to access clean and safe
                            drinking water.</li>

                <div class="contents">
                    <p>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a landmark international treaty aimed at addressing
                        climate change and its impacts.it marked a historic moment in global climate action by bringing
                        together nearly all countries in a collective effort to combat climate change. Its flexible
                        framework allows countries to set their own targets and strategies while promoting global
                        cooperation and accountability. The agreement is seen as a critical tool in the global fight
                        against climate change and has been ratified by the majority of the world's nations. Countries
                        that are parties to the agreement agreed to several key commitments and goals, including:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                        <li><b>Limiting Global Warming: </b>The central goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit the
                            increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees
                            Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational target of limiting the
                            increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is to avoid the most severe and catastrophic impacts
                            of climate change.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Emissions Reduction: </b> Each country that is a party to the agreement commits to
                            reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Parties determine their own targets, called
                            "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs), which outline their specific emission
                            reduction goals. These targets are intended to be ambitious and progressively updated to
                            reflect increased efforts over time.</li>
                        <li><b>Financial Support: </b> Developed countries committed to providing financial assistance
                            to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
                            This support is crucial for helping vulnerable nations build resilience and transition to
                            low-carbon economies.</li>
